<h1>My Valentine 💙</h1>

<p>
**My Saddonti, my love, my everything,**  
Happy Valentine’s Day, my amazing girl. ❤️❤️  

It was very hard year on us.  
We got into many problems, we got into many bad situations.  
But on the other side, we laughed a lot, we loved each other a lot,  
we had very nice time together and we still have a love for each other.  

Although we have many problems in our life,  
I still love you as the first time I loved you.  
I still used to check my phone every time I wake up  
to see if you sent me a message.  
I still check my phone to see if you send me any message.  

I have a lot of love in my heart for you.  
Even if I don't show it,  
but it's in every piece in my heart. 🫂🫂  

No matter how much I got mad from you,  
I still love you ❤️  
my candle is broken 💔🥹  

This is the second Valentine for us,  
and the first Valentine without each other…  
it’s very bad feeling.  

My dream is not with me 🥹  
I need you in everything I want to do,  
I need you beside me in every achievement I will achieve.  

I love you very much ❤️  
I hope this message makes you happy  
and touches your heart and your feelings.  

My God bless you and yehmiki ❤️  
بحبّك كتير يا أغلى ما عندي ❤️  

Karrar 🫶🏼❤️
